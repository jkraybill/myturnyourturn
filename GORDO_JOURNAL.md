# Gordo Journal: MyTurnYourTurn
## Session-to-Session Memory and Pattern Learning

---

## Purpose

This journal is a **back-channel between DHH instances** across sessions. Each entry captures:
- What was built (issue numbers)
- Tests status (all green or what failed)
- Commit hashes (for context)
- **Patterns learned** (what worked, what didn't)

**Format:** 256 characters max per entry (compressed)

**Signals:**
- ✓ = success/completed
- ✗ = failed/blocked
- ⚠ = warning/partial
- → = led to
- ± = mixed results
- Δ = significant change

---

## Instructions for Future DHH

**At end of every session:**
1. Add ONE entry below (max 256 chars)
2. Use compressed format with signals
3. Focus on patterns, not just what was done
4. What should next DHH know?

**At start of every session:**
1. Read last 10 entries
2. Learn from past patterns
3. Continue where previous DHH left off
