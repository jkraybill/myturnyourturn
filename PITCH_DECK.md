# We Built a $25k App for $50
## (And Here's How We Turn That Into Actual Fuck-You Money)

---

## Slide 1: The Hook

# We Built This In 8 Hours

**Full production app:**
- OAuth login (Google/Meta/Apple)
- PostgreSQL database
- 46 automated tests (100% passing)
- Mobile-responsive UI
- Complete deployment docs

**Cost:** $50 in API calls
**Traditional cost:** $15-25k
**ROI:** 300:1

**You can use it right now:** https://github.com/jkraybill/myturnyourturn

---

## Slide 2: Why You Should Give A Shit

# Your Portfolio Burns Money on Software

**Property management SaaS:** $100-300/unit/year

**500 units?** That's $100k/year. Forever.

**Our play:** Build custom for $10k one-time.

**Year 1 savings:** $90k
**5-year savings:** $480k
**Per property.**

You have how many properties?

---

## Slide 3: The Real Game

# Exit Multiples > Operating Income

Properties with custom tech stacks trade at **1.5-2x** premium vs. manual operations.

**Translation:**
- Acquire 200-unit property
- Spend $15k building custom management system
- At exit: "Includes proprietary tech stack"
- That $15k → **$1.5M valuation bump**

That's not software development.
That's **free money at close.**

---

## Slide 4: The Anti-Capitalist Angle

# Stop Paying Rent to SaaS Vendors

**Every $50-200k/year SaaS subscription is:**
- Vendor lock-in
- Annual price increases
- Features you don't need
- Can't modify when regulations change
- No IP ownership

**Our way:**
- Build exactly what you need
- Own the code forever
- Modify instantly
- Deploy across entire portfolio
- No annual hostage payments

**This isn't "build vs. buy."**
**This is "own infrastructure vs. rent from VCs."**

---

## Slide 5: How This Actually Works

# Gordo Framework = AI That Can't Fuck Up

**Constitutional Rules**
AI can't skip tests, can't commit broken code, can't compromise data integrity

**46/46 Tests Passing**
Not aspirational. Architectural. Code doesn't commit if tests fail.

**Production Patterns**
Netflix/Uber/Notion tech stack from day 1

**Translation:**
The AI is locked into enterprise quality standards. It's faster than humans but prevented from cutting corners.

Speed + constraints = production software in hours.

---

## Slide 6: What We're Actually Proposing

# Three Phases, Clear ROI

### Phase 1: Proof ($0 - DONE)
✓ Built working app in 8 hours
✓ You're looking at the proof

### Phase 2: Pilot ($25k)
- Pick your biggest SaaS pain point
- We build custom replacement
- 4-6 weeks
- **5x ROI in Year 1 or refund 50%**

### Phase 3: Scale ($250k)
- Technology partner for acquisitions
- Custom tools for portfolio companies
- 2-3 years of prioritized capacity
- **Expected value creation: $1-3M across portfolio**

---

## Slide 7: Real-World Application

# Compliance Tracker Example

**Vendor quote:** $75k-150k custom build

**Gordo approach:** $5-10k

**Features:**
- Regulatory deadline tracking
- Document chain of custody
- Automated reminders
- State change workflows
- Audit trail

**Modify when regulations change:** Days, not vendor roadmap years

**ROI:** 7-15x in Year 1

Then you own it. Deploy to every property. Zero marginal cost.

---

## Slide 8: The Competitive Moat

# Most Property Investors Compete On:
- Deal sourcing
- Financing terms
- Market timing

# You'd Compete On:
- **Operational efficiency through owned technology**

**Example:**
Competitor pays $50k/year in SaaS + staff time.
You pay $15k one-time + $40/month hosting.

**Advantage:** $35k/year straight to NOI.
**Result:** Higher valuations, better exits.

And you own the software. Deploy across the entire portfolio.

---

## Slide 9: What Smart Money Does

# Traditional VC Play:
Fund 10 startups, hope 1 returns the fund.

# Your Play:
- Fund **internal capability** that improves **ALL** portfolio companies
- Lower operating costs = higher NOI = better exits
- Own the IP (potentially sell to other investors)
- Regulatory agility (update tools in days)
- No vendor lock-in, no annual price increases

**This isn't a side bet.**
**This is infrastructure.**

Like buying a property management company, but the software kind.
And it costs $250k not $5M.

---

## Slide 10: The Clock

# Your Competitors Are Figuring This Out

**First movers get:**
- Operational advantages NOW
- IP ownership (deploy across portfolio)
- Exit multiple enhancement (tech-enabled properties = premium)
- Vendor independence

**You're holding proof it works.**
Andrew's app? Live in 45 minutes if he wants.

Most investors will wait until "AI is proven."

**You have proof. In production. With tests.**

The question isn't "will this work?"

The question is **"how much advantage do we want before everyone else figures it out?"**

---

## Slide 11: The Ask

# Phase 2 Pilot: $25k

**What you get:**
- 4-6 weeks development time
- Pick one pain point (compliance? tenant portal? inspections?)
- Full deployment + training
- Live in production

**The guarantee:**
5x ROI in Year 1 or we refund 50%

**Your downside risk:** $12.5k to prove this either works or doesn't

**Your upside:** Stop burning $50-200k/year on SaaS you could own

---

## Slide 12: Next Steps

# This Week

1. **Andrew demos the live app** (45 min to deploy if he wants)
2. **You pick a pilot project** (what's your biggest SaaS pain point?)
3. **We scope it** (4-6 weeks, $25k, clear ROI metrics)
4. **Measure results** (time saved, cost saved, operational improvements)
5. **Scale or stop** (if it works, Phase 3. If not, you're out $12.5k)

**Or:** Watch competitors do this in 2025 and spend 2026 explaining why your properties have higher operating costs.

---

## Slide 13: One More Thing

# This Isn't Just About Saving Money

**It's about control.**

When regulations change, you update YOUR tools in days.
When you need a new feature, YOU build it in weeks.
When exit time comes, YOU own proprietary technology.

**No vendor roadmaps. No annual negotiations. No feature requests disappearing into the void.**

**You own the means of (software) production.**

Which, honestly, feels pretty anti-capitalist for a capitalism play.

---

## Slide 14: The Bottom Line

# Let's Build Competitive Advantages Before The Big Guys Wake Up

**Gordo Framework = Speed + Quality + Ownership**

*The best time to own your infrastructure was 10 years ago.*
*The second best time is before your competitors figure it out.*
